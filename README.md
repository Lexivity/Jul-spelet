# Jul spelet

# 07/12/2020
 
Jag har tänkt göra ett text baserat spel med viusela delar. Det ska ha ett jul tema...

Jag skriver detta eftersom att jag kommer behöva en sorts “story” när jag gör spelet så att jag inte improviserar när jag väl sitter där så att det blir hemskt.

Antal karaktärer:
3 st huvudkaraktärer (inklusive dig)

Du (namn väntas)

Dina barndoms kompisar: Leo och Sarah (Tänk på att historien utspelar sig i USA och därför kommer spelet vara på Engelska)

(Namn på spelet: Christmas cafeé)

(Du och dina barndoms kompisar ska fira julafton tillsammans alla i familjerna också, så ni får uppgiften att fixa någon form av efterrätt på cafeét på stan. Men under spelets gång och tillslut hittar du din kärlek för livet: Sarah.)

__Spoilers!!!

Story:

I wake up early in the morning to the sound of my phone alarm...

I sit up in bed and reach for my phone on the nightstand next to me...

I turn off the alarm and lay down again and itch my eyes from tiredness...

When my eyes have adjusted to the light I take another look on my phone...

That's when I see a text from my childhood friend: "Sarah"...

She is making sure that I am awake and on my way too school, it is the last day of school until winter break and christmas...

She said that she is on her way to my house so that we can walk together...

What should I say?

______________________________________________________

__Sure I'll be down soon to meet you (truth good)

Great I am almost there, see you in a bit!

I proceed to quickly put on my clothes and to eat...

Then I open the door from my appartment and walk out and lock the door...

Then I proceed to walk down the three flights of stairs to the front door of my appartment complex...

I turn to my left to see Sarah Walking towards me, she nearly slips on the ice covered side walk but I quickly catch her before she falls...

Sarah: "Thanks, that was very close"

(): "A little to close"

Sarah: "But thanks to you I didn't fall"

Sarah: "Let's keep moving"

On our way to the school we pass the town center and notice that the vacant shop has been purchased and renovated...

Sarah: "Oh, it looks like a bakery or is that a café?"

(): "Looks to be a café"

In not to long we reach the school grounds...

We part ways to get to our own lockers and classes...
__Next -> School

______________________________________________________

__No thanks I would slow you down anyways (truth bad)

Oh alright then, I'll see you at school then
__Next -> School

______________________________________________________

__Oh I am already at school (lie worst)

Since when do you go up so early and walk to school? I don't belive you for a second, if you don't want to walk with me then you could have just said so...
__Next -> School

__School

I walk up to my locker and open it slowly...

The door to the locker creaking as it's slowly pulled open...

I grab my notes and my books for the morning class and close the locker again...

I start making my way towards the classroom...

Upon arriving outside I open the door and enter the classroom...

The classroom is empty and the lights are on...

I take a seat at the usual desk I sit at everyday...

In a few minutes the rest of my class arrives chatting with oneanother...

Last but not least my teacher arrives...

The class goes on like normal...

Me and some classmates pass around some notes and laughs...

Finally the teacher says that class is over and we can go to lunch...

I exit the classroom and find Sarah waiting outside for me...
